# Folder Error Selector and Deleter

This Python script enters each subfolder in a given main folder, selects 60 files from each subfolder, and deletes the rest.

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python script.py /path/to/your/main_folder
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/main_folder` with the actual path to the main folder containing subfolders.

## Caution

This script permanently deletes files. Use it with caution and ensure you have a backup of important data.
